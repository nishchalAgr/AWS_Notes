# S3_Storage_Tiers
 - S3 Standard
    - General Purpose
    - High durability and availability
 - S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (IA)
    - Less frequent access
    - rapid access when needed
    - Low cost compared to standard
 - S3 One Zone-IA
    - Same as IA, but stored in one AZ
    - Same high durability
    - Low latency, high throughput
    - 20% lower cost compared to IA
 - S3 Intelligent Tiering
    - Automatically moves objects between two access tiers based on changing access patterns
    - Small monthly monitoring and auto-tiering fee
    - Same low latency and high throughput as Standard
    - High durability and availability
 - Glacier
    - Low cost object storage meant for archiving
    - Long term data retention (10s of years)
    - Alternative to on-premise magnetic tape storage
    - Exteremly small cost per GB, plus retrieval cost
    - Each "Archive", stored in "Vaults" can be up to 40TB in size
    - 3 retrieval options:
        - Expedited: 1 - 5 minutes
        - Standard: 3 - 5 hours
        - Bulk: 5 - 12 hours
    - Min storage duration of 90 days
 - Glacier Deep Archive
    - Even cheaper
    - 2 retrieval options:
        - Standard - 12hrs
        - Bulk - 48 hrs
    - Min storage duration of 180 days

## S3 Lifecycle Rules
 - Allows for the automation of moving objects between S3 storage tiers
 - Transition actions: it defines when objects are transitioned to another storage class 
 - Expiration actions: configure objects to delete after some time
    - Can be applied to old versions of objects
 - Rules can be created for a certain prefix or object tags
